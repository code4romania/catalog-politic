Catalog Politic aims to become the first profile aggregator of political figures.

[See the project live](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/5328b672-cd71-431d-5a44-c4ddcb08eb40-2519/)

Information about political figures is highly dispared, the public accessible data can be found in many sources. Many of them are unknown to the public or simply too hard to find. The aim of the project is to make this data transparent, so that any information can be easily accessible.
